"""
Exercise 2:
    
Step 0: 
    Create an empty list "numbers"
    
Step 1: 
    Retrieve numbers one by one using the input() function and a loop.
    When the string "stop" will be provided it indicates the last number has    
    been given.
    Each number given will be stored into the list numbers.
    
Step 2:
    Print the list numbers
    
Step 3:
    Compute the minimum, the maximum and the average of the numbers stored in the list
Step 4:
    Compute the "truncated mean" of the numbers. The "truncated mean" takes into account all numbers except the smallest and largest ones:
    Ex: [1,2,1,4,5,2,3,6,6,4,3]
    -> [2,4,5,2,3,4,3] -> compute the mean
